# Mistborn (series)

Don't listen to what r/bookscirclejerk says. It's a very good book, with a very cool hard magic system, unironically.

Mistborn Era 1 is one of the best book / series I've ever read. Era 2, however, is pretty mediocre.

- Mistborn Era 1
	1. The Final Empire
	2. The Well of Ascension
	3. Hero of Ages
	4. Secret History
		- novella
- Mistborn Era 2
	1. The Alloy of Law
	2. Shadow of Self
	3. The Bands of Mourning
